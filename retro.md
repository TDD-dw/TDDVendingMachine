# Day 1, round 1 - Kondal, Mark, Terry, Ed

## How does this feel?
- a little rough getting familiar with JS
- local development environment, getting comfortable with it
- like the problem, familiar use case
- adhering to a strict workflow with the TDD and mobbing

## What to do differently?
- staying time aware, switching right away
- track later test cases, todo items

# Day 1, round 2 - Kondal, Mark, Terry, Ed

## How does this feel?
- still learning
- need to understand 'this'

## What to do differently?
- randomize the order every round

# Day 4, round 1 -  Mark, Terry, Ed, Shan, Devon, Angy, Doja

## How does this feel?
- time felt rushed but slow at the same time
- group felt quieter
- went well as multiple people had to onboard
- frazzled in the beginning, due to new code
- roles were difficult to maintain in larger group 

## What to do differently?
- more detailed code walk through, maybe?
- new to code base navigate later in the cycle
- five minutes to read the code in the beginning
- utilize co-navigators, everyone who is not the navigator or driver

# Day 4, round 2 -  Mark, Terry, Ed, Shan, Devon, Doja

## How does this feel?
- Started to flow better as a group
- some guilt over too much dictation of direction when not navigator
- it is not just mob, but figuring out how to work with new people each time
- would have been nice to know which group branch beforehand

## What to do differently?
- use a task list to remind us of different things we want to hit, keep it updated

# Day 6, round 1 -  Mark, Terry, Ed, Shan, Devon, Tsura, Lidia, Angy

## How does this feel?
- I shouldn't miss sessions, makes it harder to catch up
- 4 minutes was 4 minutes, just the time we had
- shorter time for larger group was good

## What to do differently?
- this went well.
# Day 7, round 1 -  Terry,  Doja, Vivian S, Angy

## How does this feel?
- Not flowing as easily as when Ed has driven
- feeling bumpy because of half written test.  Trying to get it back to a good red state.
  - it's getting there
- so far so good.  taking some time to come back up to speed.  (missed last session).
- talking about design. going stepwise through  the code.  going in a good direction.
  - step by step.  doing bare min.
  - 

## What to do differently?
- 

# Day 7, round 2 -  Terry,  Doja, Vivian S, Angy

## How does this feel?
- After talking about the design of makeChange, the flow of the mob went well
- We got a lot of code in a finished an AC, Return Coins
- Good design discussion to be able to move quickly in the code
- Finished an AC, so it was good

## What to do differently?
- If the group anticipates a design discussion, set aside some time to discuss before setting
the 4 minute timer to code
