# Day 1, round 1 - Kondal, Mark, Terry, Ed

## How does this feel?

- a little rough getting familiar with JS
- local development environment, getting comfortable with it
- like the problem, familiar use case
- adhering to a strict workflow with the TDD and mobbing

## What to do differently?

- staying time aware, switching right away
- track later test cases, todo items

# Day 1, round 2 - Kondal, Mark, Terry, Ed

## How does this feel?

- still learning
- need to understand 'this'

## What to do differently?

- randomize the order every round

# Day 4, round 1 - Mark, Terry, Ed, Shan, Devon, Angy, Doja

## How does this feel?

- time felt rushed but slow at the same time
- group felt quieter
- went well as multiple people had to onboard
- frazzled in the beginning, due to new code
- roles were difficult to maintain in larger group

## What to do differently?

- more detailed code walk through, maybe?
- new to code base navigate later in the cycle
- five minutes to read the code in the beginning
- utilize co-navigators, everyone who is not the navigator or driver

# Day 4, round 2 - Mark, Terry, Ed, Shan, Devon, Doja

## How does this feel?

- Started to flow better as a group
- some guilt over too much dictation of direction when not navigator
- it is not just mob, but figuring out how to work with new people each time
- would have been nice to know which group branch beforehand

## What to do differently?

- use a task list to remind us of different things we want to hit, keep it updated

# Day 6, round 1 - Mark, Terry, Ed, Shan, Devon, Tsura, Lidia, Angy

## How does this feel?

- I shouldn't miss sessions, makes it harder to catch up
- 4 minutes was 4 minutes, just the time we had
- shorter time for larger group was good

## What to do differently?

- this went well.

# Day 7, round 1 - Mark, Devon, Lidia, Vivian Liao

## How does this feel?

- it went fast
- pretty smooth
- better context of the code after working with the group
- it's hard to think about make it pass right away for the small changes we are making.
- likes red, green, refactor cycle

## What to do differently?

- get to green fast, then refactor
- do the small tests, so we don't miss whole pieces of code

# Day 7, round 2 - Mark, Devon, Lidia, Vivian Liao

## How does this feel?

- More refactored focused
- feels good to address a requirement that was missed
- trying to make sure all pieces stay connected when refactoring can be hard

## What to do differently?

- Things are going smoothly, continue as is.

# Day 8, round 1 - Mark, Devon, Lidia, Angy

## How does this feel?

- Refactoring is tricky
- confusing
- it feels fast

## What to do differently?

- write a smaller test
- run one test at a time

# Day 8, round 2 - Mark, Devon, Lidia, Angy

## How does this feel?

- Felt good to refactor out the if-else branches
- Nice to learn new things together while working on aproblem
- Bit overwhelming, JS objects & their methods are new
- Nice to get a reminder to start working with the smallest tests
- .only is handy!
- Reminder that you just have to try, with the help of tests

## What to do differently?

- Take more time to explore a concept together (e.g. looking at MDN)
- Ensure the driver can participate in these discussions about new concepts

# Day 8, round 3 - Mark, Devon, Angy

## How does this feel?

- More focused
- Sensation of progress that wasn't found in refactoring
- WoW smoothed out in this round

## What to do differently?

- continue as we are.
