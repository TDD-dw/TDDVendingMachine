# Day 1, round 1 - group member names: Lidia De la Cruz, Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Doja Abiose

## How does this feel?

- Feels 6/10, so much to think from others and yourself
- mobbing seems tedious
- having fun
- still a little clunky with all the roles

## What to do differently?

- we should mob for 10 min
- discussion before navigator/driver implement



# Day 1, round 2 - group member names: Lidia De la Cruz, Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Doja Abiose

## How does this feel?
- faster than previous round
- better discussions 
- fine-tuned our process now
- still having fun 
- Feels 6/10

## What to do differently?
- ask co-navs if there's anything to refactor at end of session 
- 


# Day 2, round 1 - group member names: Lidia De la Cruz, Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Doja Abiose

## How does this feel?
- better than tuesday
- randomizer helps a lot
- ways of working (we're norming instead of storming)
- big difference now that we've worked together (for 2 hours last time)
- Fist of Five: [0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 4: 4]
- there is overlap of folks talking at the same time, driver finds it hard to hear/listen/ask 

## What to do differently?
- not sure, something to do with roles/who's talking


# Day 2, round 2 - group member names: Lidia De la Cruz, Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Doja Abiose

## How does this feel?
- wants to get the problem done already
- TDD is sensible default
- discussions were helpful, great to have Chris, especially clarification on the steps of TDD
- still learning TDD: focus on GET THE TEST PASS, not thinking too far ahead
- was good to hear about whitebox/blackbox testing: I.E. refactor the tests too, you can remove 

## What to do differently?
- don't talk over people
- keep having discussions, keep suggesting things and explaining how they would work or why it would be beneficial performance or readability (object vs array), e.g. later we can use this object again, whereas right now an array can satisfy get the test to pass but isn't very usable later
