# Day 1, round 1 - group member names: Lidia De la Cruz, Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Doja Abiose

## How does this feel?

- Feels 6/10, so much to think from others and yourself
- mobbing seems tedious
- having fun
- still a little clunky with all the roles

## What to do differently?

- we should mob for 10 min
- discussion before navigator/driver implement



# Day 1, round 2 - group member names: Lidia De la Cruz, Paul Rinaldi, Shan Li, Doja Abiose

## How does this feel?
- faster than previous round
- better discussions 
- fine-tuned our process now
- still having fun 
- Feels 6/10

## What to do differently?
- ask co-navs if there's anything to refactor at end of session
